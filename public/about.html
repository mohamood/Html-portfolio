  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello! My name is Mohamood Abdirisak, and I am 29 years old. I was born in Somalia and currently live in Uganda. I hold a diploma in Architecture and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My passion lies in web design and web development.</p>
  <p>I have always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity, which led me to pursue studies in both architecture and computer science. This unique combination of skills allows me to approach web design and development from both an aesthetic and functional perspective. I strive to create websites that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional and user-friendly.</p>

  <p>In my journey as a web designer and developer, I have worked on various projects that have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various web development frameworks. I am constantly learning and staying updated with the latest trends and technologies in the industry to ensure that my work remains cutting-edge and relevant.</p>

  <p>When I am not coding or designing, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading about advancements in web development, and engaging with the tech community. I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and helping others to grow in this ever-evolving field. I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning, and I am always open to new opportunities and challenges.</p>
